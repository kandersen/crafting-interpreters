# Challenges

## Scanning

  [X] Add C-style block comments (including newlines). Try and make them
      nesting.

## Representing Code

  [X] Define a visitor for expressions that takes an expression, converts it to
      RPN, and returns the resulting string.

## Parsing Expressions

  [X] Add the comma operator. It sequences a series of expressions, evaluates
      them in order, and discards all results but that last.

  [ ] Add a ternary operator `?:`. What is the precedence, is the whole operator
      left- or right-associative?

  [ ] Add error productions for binary operators without left-hand operators.
