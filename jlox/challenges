# Challenges

## Scanning

  [X] Add C-style block comments (including newlines). Try and make them
      nesting.

## Representing Code

  [X] Define a visitor for expressions that takes an expression, converts it to
      RPN, and returns the resulting string.

## Parsing Expressions

  [X] Add the comma operator. It sequences a series of expressions, evaluates
      them in order, and discards all results but that last.

  [ ] Add a ternary operator `?:`. What is the precedence, is the whole operator
      left- or right-associative?

  [ ] Add error productions for binary operators without left-hand operators.
     
## Interpreting Expressions

  [x] Extend the interpreter to support that if either operand to `+` is a
  string, the other is converted to a string and the results are concatenated.
  
  [X] Extend the implementation to report a runtime error for division by zero.

## Statements and State

  [ ] Add the ability to enter both statements or expressions in the REPL.
  Execute one, evaluate the other.

  [ ] Make it a runtime error to access variables that have not been
  initialized.

## Control Flow

  [ ] Add `break` statements.
